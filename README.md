## Introduction

The Real Estate Sales Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of a company's sales performance, product distribution and regional market insights. It is designed to facilitate data-driven decision-making by offering clear visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs).

This dashboard highlights total sales, profit, and quantity sold, while also breaking down performance by product type, country, and salesperson. It enables stakeholders to monitor revenue trends, identify top-selling products and evaluate the effectiveness of the sales team. Additionally, the interactive slicers allow for focused analysis by country and salesperson, helping the management make more informed strategic decisions.

By leveraging this dashboard, the company can optimize inventory management, enhance regional targeting, and maximize overall profitability.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation

* Calculated **Total Profit** using the formula:  
SUMX(
    'Customer Transactions',
    RELATED('Product Inventory & Pricing'[Invoice Amount])
    - RELATED('Product Inventory & Pricing'[Cost])
)

### 3. DAX Calculations

* Created DAX measures:

  * **Total Sales:**  SUM('Customer Transactions'[Amount Paid]).
  * **Total Profit:** SUMX(
    'Customer Transactions',
    RELATED('Product Inventory & Pricing'[Invoice Amount]) - RELATED('Product Inventory & Pricing'[Cost])).
  * **Quantity Sold:** SUM('Customer Transactions'[Quantity Purchased]).
  

### 4. Visualization

* Customized the bar chart to display the highest bars in a specific color.
